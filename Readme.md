# Other Resources

 - [elm-seedling](https://github.com/splodingsocks/elm-seedling) - A nice little boilerplate by yours truly
 - [package.elm-lang.org](http://package.elm-lang.org/) - For searching 3rd party packages
 - [api search](http://klaftertief.github.io/package.elm-lang.org/) - For searching type signatures, or function names

## Quickstart

 - `npm install`
 - `npm start` : Runs `serve` and `watch` concurrently for you

## Getting Elm set up for the first time

After running `npm install`, a version of Elm will be installed into your
node modules folder, and can be interacted with by running `./node_modules/.bin/elm`.

That folder can just be added to your path, or you can install Elm globally
by typing `npm install -g elm`

Wahoo!
